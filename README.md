# Forage Data Science Projects

Welcome to my Forage Data Science Projects! This repository documents my journey through 100 days of learning project-driven data science.

## Projects

1. **Project 1: [ACCENTURE DATA ANALYTICS AND VISUALIZATION]**
 Description
We conducted a comprehensive data analysis project for Social Buzz, a rapidly growing social media platform. Our goal was to audit their big data practices, provide IPO recommendations, and analyze content category popularity to inform their scaling strategy.
Tools

- Tools: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
Outcome

Identified the top 5 content categories by popularity
Provided insights on content popularity trends throughout the day
Developed recommendations for targeted content scheduling
Highlighted opportunities for cross-category content development
Identified underperforming categories for potential improvement
Delivered a comprehensive report on big data best practices
Prepared actionable recommendations for a successful IPO

2.**Project 2: [British Airways]**
Description:
The goal of this project was to scrape customer reviews from the Skytrax website, specifically focusing on feedback related to British Airways (BA). After collecting the reviews, I performed data cleaning, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling to identify key insights about customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction. The project aimed to uncover trends in customer sentiment, common themes in the feedback, and actionable insights to help BA improve its service quality and customer experience.

Tools:
Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup, Selenium
Programming Language: Python
Data Cleaning and Analysis: Pandas, NumPy, NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
Sentiment Analysis: Vader, TextBlob
Topic Modeling: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud
PowerPoint: Microsoft PowerPoint for presenting results
Outcome:
The data scraping process collected a comprehensive dataset of BA reviews. Through sentiment analysis, I found that a majority of the reviews were positive, particularly regarding staff service and in-flight comfort. However, negative reviews focused on delays, luggage handling, and pricing issues. Topic modeling revealed key themes such as “on-time performance,” “staff friendliness,” and “baggage issues.” The insights were summarized in a PowerPoint slide with visualizations, providing actionable recommendations for British Airways to address customer pain points and enhance overall service quality.
3. **Project 3: [Project Title]**
    - Description: Brief description of the project.
    - Tools: List of tools and technologies used.
    - Outcome: Summary of the results or findings.
